# Task Manager Web App

## Overview

The Task Manager Web App is a simple, user-friendly application designed to help users manage their tasks effectively. It allows users to create, view, update, and delete tasks, providing an intuitive and streamlined experience for organizing daily activities. This project aims to provide a seamless, responsive UI and backend integration for efficient task management.

## Features

- **Create Tasks**: Users can add new tasks by providing a title and description.
- **View Tasks**: A list of tasks is displayed, showing the title, description, and status.
- **Update Tasks**: Users can edit task details, including task status (e.g., completed, in-progress).
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be deleted once completed or no longer needed.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and optimized for both mobile and desktop views.
- **Authentication (Future feature)**: Integration with user authentication systems (like Firebase) to track user tasks individually.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: 
  - HTML5
  - CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid)
  - JavaScript (ES6+)
  - React.js (For component-based structure)
  
- **Backend** (Planned Future Enhancements):
  - Node.js with Express.js (for RESTful APIs)
  - Firebase or MongoDB (for data storage)

- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub for collaboration and version tracking.

## Installation

To get started with the Task Manager Web App locally:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/task-manager-web-app.git
   cd task-manager-web-app

     npm install
     ```

3. **Start the Application**:
   - To run the app in development mode:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

   This will launch the application on [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000).
